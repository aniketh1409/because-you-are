# Because You Are (Work in Progress)
## About the Project
Because You Are is a short, linear interactive experience built in Godot 4. It’s inspired by Undertale and focuses on a 5 -15 minute emotional journey about self-love. The goal is to walk through a series of "frames," interacting with NPCs who reflect your value back to you through dialogue and small tasks.
